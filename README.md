# ACM-Round-2
Hi. 
So I explored the AI/ML vertical and I am pretty sure that I want to pursue this only. Largely influenced by the emergence of chatGPT chatbot. This thing has blown my mind which no vertical has done so far xD.

I started out with CS229 Stanford course but couldn't pursue it as I would have liked. Just 2 lectures. Mostly because I fell ill and had my quizzes in between.

Neverthless, I tried my best.

I am done with the basics of necessary python libraries. NUmpy,Pandas,Matplotlib and Pytorch.

I had a lot of fun exploring this. Never knew reading documentation of python libraries could be interesting.

Lastly, I learnt about Neural networks and how they work and created a small non model on a MNIST dataset.

I am adding everything that I have done in the past few days in this repo:)
